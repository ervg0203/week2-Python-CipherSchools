# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update
# data inside tuple

example = ('one','two','three')
# no append , nno insert, no pop, no remove
# days = ('monday', 'tuesday')
# tuples are faster than lists

# methods
# count,Index
# len function
# slicing
example[0] = 1
print(example)
